They can be used quite well with regular Arduino projects in addition to the Makerbot.In order to do this, the Arduino pin number definitions are needed and a set of libraries to handle the various components is useful.This code is now on github and includes a complete library with example code to run the entire system.https://github.com/msproul/MakerbotArduinoIf you prefer not to use github and just want to download a zip filehttp://www.avr-developers.com/makerbot/makerbotGen4.zipTo use this library download it and put it in the libraries folder inside your sketches folder. You will be able to use it like any other Arduino library.Features    Interrupt driven stepper motor drivers    Full support for the X, Y, and Z end stops inside the interrupt handler    Supports all 5 stepper motors    Easy to use menu system for utilizing the Display board LCD and buttons    Direct motion and linear motion routines available. Linear means draw a straight     line, Direct means axises are independent (linear only in X, Y)Compatibility:Since the makerbot motherboard only works with an Arduino mega 1280 or 2560, that restriction also applies to this library. It currently does not work on the chipkit Max32 board (Arduino compatible pic32) but I am working on support for it.
